/* 
Here is a brief documentation for the code:

This program calculates the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a given graph using Primâ€™s algorithm. The graph is represented as an adjacency matrix where graph[i][j] represents the weight of the edge between nodes i and j. If there is no edge between nodes i and j, then graph[i][j] is 0.

The program starts by initializing an array key[] to store the minimum weight edge for each node and an array mstSet[] to keep track of the nodes included in the MST. The key[] values are initialized to INT_MAX and the mstSet[] values are initialized to false.

The program then enters a loop that runs until all nodes have been included in the MST. In each iteration of the loop, the program selects the node with the minimum key value that has not yet been included in the MST and adds it to the MST. The program then updates the key values of all adjacent nodes that have not yet been included in the MST.

After all nodes have been included in the MST, the program calculates the total weight of the MST by summing up the weights of all edges in the MST and stores the result in the mst variable. */
